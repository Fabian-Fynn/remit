**Remit** is a web app for commit-by-commit code review of GitHub repositories. A modern, live UI thanks to AngularJS and WebSockets.

It's super easy to set up on a free Heroku instance.

Keeps track of what has been reviewed and links to GitHub commits for the actual review.

Also tracks comments on commits.

### Demo

Review the Remit commits using Remit:

<https://remit-on-remit.herokuapp.com/?auth_key=demo>

Please keep in mind that it's meant to be [used within Fluid.app](#use-with-fluidapp) so you get a GitHub panel on the side.

### Why commit-by-commit review?

If you think truly continuous integration and delivery (perhaps with feature flags) is important, you may prefer not to work with pull requests as a rule.

If you don't work with pull requests, commit-by-commit review is what you get. It has some benefits and some downsides compared to review by pull request.

Read more in this blog post: ["The risks of feature branches and pre-merge code review"](http://thepugautomatic.com/2014/02/code-review/).

### The name

* <b>Re</b>view com<b>mit</b>s
* Dictionary meanings like
  * "an item referred to someone for consideration"
  * "forgive (a sin)"

## Development

Assumes you have
  * Ruby 2.1.2
  * Bundler

Run:

    bundle
    bin/rake db:setup
    cp config/initializers/pusher.rb{.template,}
    # Configure for development per https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pusher
    vim config/initializers/pusher.rb
    bin/rails server

Visit <http://localhost:9292>

### Fake incoming webhooks

    rake dev:commits N=3   # 3 new commits from GitHub
    rake dev:comments N=3  # 3 new comments from GitHub
    rake dev:deploy        # Heroku says it deployed

### Import a production DB into dev

    heroku addons:add pgbackups:auto-month  # Free
    rake dev:db

You may need to exit Rails consoles and servers to avoid an error about DB being in use.

### See what a full payload looks like

See `db/seeds/push.json` (commits) and `db/seeds/commit_comment.json` (comments).


## Test

    # Full suite
    rake

    # Only Ruby tests, skip JS unit tests
    rake spec

    # Only JS unit tests (Jasmine in a headless browser)
    # Yes, you need to provide the RAILS_ENV: https://github.com/searls/jasmine-rails/issues/121
    RAILS_ENV=test rake spec:javascript

    # The same JS unit tests in a headful browser
    # Assumes you've started a dev server with bin/rails server
    open http://localhost:3000/specs


## Production

### Set the app up on Heroku

    heroku new remit-SOMETHING-UNIQUE

    heroku config:set AUTH_KEY=`ruby -rsecurerandom -e "puts SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64"` WEBHOOK_KEY=`ruby -rsecurerandom -e "puts SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64"` SECRET_KEY_BASE=`rake secret`

    # DB. Free plan with max 10,000 rows.
    heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev

    # For WebSockets. Free plan with 20 concurrents, 100,000 messages/month. https://addons.heroku.com/pusher
    heroku addons:add pusher

    heroku addons:add deployhooks:http --url=https://remit-SOMETHING-UNIQUE.herokuapp.com/heroku_webhook?auth_key=MY_WEBHOOK_KEY

    git push heroku master
    heroku run rake db:schema:load

If you want to use [Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io) for exception tracking, also do

    heroku config:set HONEYBADGER_API_KEY=your_key

### Configure the webhook on GitHub

Working at [Barsoom](http://barsoom.se)? [We've got you covered.](https://github.com/barsoom/servers/wiki/Automatically-apply-webhooks-to-all-our-repos)

Not so fortunate? In the settings for any repo you want to use this with, add a webhook:

    Payload URL:   https://remit-SOMETHING-UNIQUE.herokuapp.com/github_webhook?auth_key=MY_WEBHOOK_KEY
    Content type:  application/json
    Let me select individual events:  [x] Push  [x] Commit comment

Where `MY_WEBHOOK_KEY` is whatever you assigned above (see it again with `heroku config:get WEBHOOK_KEY`).

### Reload clients automatically

To reload clients automatically when you deploy to Heroku, change the version number in `config/application.rb`.

If you've set up a Heroku deploy webhook per the instructions above, it will be called after deploy and generate a Pusher WebSocket message with the new version number. That message causes clients to reload if they're running a different version.

### Import reviewed state from Hubreview

Did you use our predecessor [Hubreview](https://github.com/joakimk/hubreview)?

Run this in a Heroku console in the Hubreview repo:

```
json = Revision.where(reviewed: true).pluck(:name, :in_review_at, :created_at, :review_time).map { |n,ra,ca,rt| { sha: n, at: ((ra || ca) + rt.to_i).to_i } }.to_json; nil
File.write("tmp/json", json)
`scp tmp/json you@your-server`
```

And this in Remit:

```
`scp you@your-server:json tmp/json`
raw = File.read("tmp/json"); raw.length
data = JSON.parse(raw); data.first
data.each { |x| Commit.where(sha: x["sha"]).where("reviewed_at IS NULL").update_all(reviewed_at: Time.at(x["at"])) }
```


## Use with Fluid.app

Remit is intended to be used side-by-side with a GitHub pane.

This is sadly not possible with regular frames or iframes, as GitHub doesn't allow embedding. But it can be achieved with [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/).

Fluid.app is for OS X. Please do contribute instructions for other platforms.

* Install [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/).
* Launch Fluid.app, create a new app:
  * The URL should be `http://github.com`.
  * Use any name and icon you like. It defaults to the GitHub icon.
  * Let it launch the app.
* Open your app's preferences and configure it like this:
  * Whitelist:
    * Allow browsing to any URL
  * Panel Preferences:
    * [X] New windows automatically display visible Panels from previous window
    * Panel split divider style: thin (a purely aesthetic choice; may need a restart of the app to kick in)
  * The first of the two "Browsa" panels:
    * Enter the Remit URL as home page, including the `auth_key` parameter. E.g. `https://remit-SOMETHING-UNIQUE.herokuapp.com/?auth_key=MY_AUTH_KEY`
    * Navigation bar: is always hidden
    * Clicked links open in: current tab in current window
* In the "Panels" menu, select the first Browsa panel to show it
* Drag the divider until it looks good

Remit will automatically remove the `target="_blank"` from links when Fluid.app is detected, so "current tab in current window" does the right thing.
