# Remit

**Very much a work in progress! Beware.**

Web app for commit-by-commit code review of GitHub repositories. A modern, live UI thanks to AngularJS and WebSockets.

Keeps track of what has been reviewed and links to GitHub commits for the actual review.

Also tracks comments on commits.

### Demo

Review the Remit commits using Remit:

<https://remit-on-remit.herokuapp.com/?auth_key=demo>

### Why commit-by-commit review?

If you think truly continuous integration and delivery (perhaps with feature flags) is important, you may prefer not to work with pull requests as a rule.

If you don't work with pull requests, commit-by-commit review is what you get. It has some benefits and some downtimes compared to review by pull request.

### The name

* <b>Re</b>view com<b>mit</b>s
* Dictionary meanings like
  * "an item referred to someone for consideration"
  * "forgive (a sin)"

## Setup

### Development

Assumes you have
  * Ruby 2.1.2
  * Bundler

Run:

    bundle
    bin/rake db:setup
    cp config/initializers/pusher.rb{.template,}
    # Configure for development per https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pusher
    vim config/initializers/pusher.rb
    bin/rails server

Visit <http://localhost:9292>

#### Fake new data coming in

    rake dev:commits N=3  # 3 new commits
    rake dev:comments N=3  # 3 new comments

### Test

    rake

### Production

#### Set the app up on Heroku

    heroku new remit-SOMETHING-UNIQUE

    # DB. Free plan with max 10,000 rows.
    heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev

    # For WebSockets. Free plan with 20 concurrents, 100,000 messages/month. https://addons.heroku.com/pusher
    heroku addons:add pusher

    heroku config:set AUTH_KEY=`ruby -rsecurerandom -e "puts SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64"` WEBHOOK_KEY=`ruby -rsecurerandom -e "puts SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64"` SECRET_KEY_BASE=`rake secret`
    git push heroku master
    heroku run rake db:schema:load

#### Configure the webhook on GitHub

Working at [Barsoom](http://barsoom.se)? [We've got you covered.](https://github.com/barsoom/servers/wiki/Automatically-apply-webhooks-to-all-our-repos)

Not so fortunate? In the settings for any repo you want to use this with, add a webhook:

    Payload URL:   https://remit-SOMETHING-UNIQUE.herokuapp.com/github_webhook?auth_key=MY_WEBHOOK_KEY
    Content type:  application/json
    Let me select individual events:  [x] Push  [x] Commit comment

Where `MY_AUTH_KEY` is whatever you assigned above (see it again with `heroku config:get WEBHOOK_KEY`).


## Use with Fluid.app

With [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/), you can see Remit side-by-side with GitHub in two panes.

This is not possible with regular iframes, as GitHub doesn't allow embedding.

Fluid.app is for OS X. Please do contribute instructions for other platforms.

* Install [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/).
* Launch Fluid.app, create a new app:
  * The URL should be `http://github.com`.
  * Use any name and icon you like. It defaults to the GitHub icon.
  * Let it launch the app.
* Open your app's preferences and configure it like this:
  * Whitelist:
    * Allow browsing to any URL
  * Panel Preferences:
    * Panel split divider style: thin (may need a restart of the app to kick in)
  * The first of the two "Browsa" panels:
    * Enter the Remit URL as home page, including the `?auth_key=SOMETHING` parameter, and tack on an `app=true` parameter.
    * Navigation bar: is always hidden
    * Clicked links open in: current tab in current window
* In the "Panels" menu, select the first Browsa panel to show it
* Drag the divider until it looks good

The `app=true` parameter tells Remit you want it to behave differently than in a regular browser.
