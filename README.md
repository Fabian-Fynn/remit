# Remit

**Very much a work in progress! Beware.**

Web app for commit-by-commit code review of GitHub repositories.

Keeps track of what has been reviewed and links to GitHub commits for the actual review.

Also tracks comments on commits.

### Why commit-by-commit review?

If you think truly continuous integration and delivery (perhaps with feature flags) is important, you may not work with pull requests as a rule.

If you don't work with pull requests, commit-by-commit review is what you get.

### The name

* <b>Re</b>view com<b>mit</b>s
* Dictionary meanings like
  * "an item referred to someone for consideration"
  * "forgive (a sin)"

## Setup

### Development

Assumes you have
  * Ruby 2.1.2
  * Bundler

Run:

    bundle
    bin/rake db:setup
    cp config/initializers/pusher.rb{.template,}
    # Configure for development per https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pusher
    vim config/initializers/pusher.rb
    bin/rails server

Visit <http://localhost:9292>

### Test

    rake

### Production

#### Set the app up on Heroku

    heroku new remit-SOMETHING-UNIQUE
    heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev
    heroku addons:add pusher
    heroku config:set AUTH_KEY=`ruby -rsecurerandom -e "puts SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64"` SECRET_KEY_BASE=`rake secret`
    git push heroku master

#### Configure the webhook on GitHub

Working at [Barsoom](http://barsoom.se)? [We've got you covered.](https://github.com/barsoom/servers/wiki/Automatically-apply-webhooks-to-all-our-repos)

Not so fortunate? In the settings for any repo you want to use this with, add a webhook:

    Payload URL:   https://remit-SOMETHING-UNIQUE.herokuapp.com/github_webhook?auth_key=MY_AUTH_KEY
    Content type:  application/json
    Let me select individual events:  [x] Push  [x] Commit comment

Where `MY_AUTH_KEY` is whatever you assigned above (see it again with `heroku config:get AUTH_KEY`).
