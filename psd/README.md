The "R" is Futura LT ExtraBold colored #2e2e2e.

The "<>" is Arial Narrow Bold with extra boldness added, colored #ec554a (red) and #4aec7f (green).

"R" for Remit.

"<>" in those colors to represent code and terminals. Also rejecting (red, less than) and accepting (green, greater than). Also intended to evoke a scrutinizing eye. And of course to act as counter (hole) in the letter R.
